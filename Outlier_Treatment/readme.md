# Outlier Treatment in Data Analysis on Car Crashes Data

## Introduction
This project focuses on the detection and treatment of outliers in a dataset related to car crashes. The dataset contains various columns, including:

- `total`: Total number of car crashes.
- `speeding`: Number of car crashes attributed to speeding.
- `alcohol`: Number of car crashes related to alcohol consumption.
- `not_distracted`: Number of car crashes where distractions were not involved.
- `no_previous`: Number of car crashes with no previous history of accidents.
- `ins_premium`: Insurance premium total.
- `ins_losses`: Insurance losses total.
- `abbrev`: State abbreviations.

The primary goal of this project is to identify and handle outliers in this dataset using the boxplot method, which is a powerful visualization technique for detecting data points that deviate significantly from the majority.

## Outlier Detection
Outliers are extreme data points that deviate from the overall pattern of the dataset. In this project, we will use the boxplot method to identify potential outliers for each of the columns mentioned above. The boxplot visually represents the distribution of data and highlights data points that fall outside the "whiskers" of the plot.

## Outlier Treatment
Once we have identified potential outliers, we will explore various methods to handle them. Outlier treatment methods may include:

- **Removal**: Removing the identified outliers from the dataset.
- **Transformation**: Applying mathematical transformations to the data to make the distribution more normal.
- **Imputation**: Replacing outliers with more reasonable values.
- **Winsorization**: Capping the extreme values to a predefined percentile.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/hiranvjoseph/outlier-treatment-car-crashes.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. You can use a virtual environment for this:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to detect and treat outliers in the car crashes dataset.

4. Analyze the results and evaluate the impact of outlier treatment on your data analysis.
