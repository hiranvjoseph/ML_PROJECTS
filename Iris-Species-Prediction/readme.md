![iris1](https://github.com/hiranvjoseph/Machine-Learning-Prediction-Projects-Repository/assets/32574833/2f1fcba9-0314-4a7d-9fb0-5362228af848)

Iris Classification is a machine learning project that utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal characteristics.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 151 entries, each with the following features:

- **Sepal Length**: Length of the iris flower's sepal.
- **Sepal Width**: Width of the iris flower's sepal.
- **Petal Length**: Length of the iris flower's petal.
- **Petal Width**: Width of the iris flower's petal.
- **Species**: Target variable representing the species of the iris flower (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica).

## Project Overview

The project involves using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal characteristics. The model is trained on the provided dataset and can make predictions for new data.

## File Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`Iris_Dataset.csv`**: The dataset file containing iris flower characteristics.
- **`Iris_Classification.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data exploration, model training, and predictions.
- **`images/`**: Folder containing images used in the project, such as visualizations or plots.
- **`database_setup.sql`**: SQL file with the database setup for storing input values.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project, dataset, and file structure.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hiranvjoseph/Machine-Learning-Prediction-Projects-Repository/iris-classification.git
   cd iris-classification
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   Open and run the `Iris_Classification.ipynb` notebook to explore the data, train the model, and make predictions.

## Usage

The project demonstrates how to use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for iris flower species classification. The Jupyter Notebook provides step-by-step guidance on data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

## Database Setup

The `database_setup.sql` file contains the SQL code for setting up a database to store input values. Run this script if you want to store input values in a database.

```bash
mysql -u root -p house < database_setup.sql
```

## Demo

For a quick demonstration, please refer to the `demo/README.md` file.
