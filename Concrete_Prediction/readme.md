![Concrete](https://images.pexels.com/photos/545008/pexels-photo-545008.jpeg)

## Project Description

This GitHub repository contains a data analysis project on multiple regression using the "Concrete Data" dataset. The dataset consists of various input features, such as cement, slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, and age, to predict the compressive strength (csMPa) of concrete. The project aims to explore and implement various regression models to predict concrete strength.

## Introduction
This project explores the application of multiple regression techniques to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on various input features. The dataset used for this analysis includes the following columns:

- `cement`: Amount of cement in the concrete mix (kg/m³)
- `slag`: Amount of blast furnace slag in the concrete mix (kg/m³)
- `flyash`: Amount of fly ash in the concrete mix (kg/m³)
- `water`: Amount of water in the concrete mix (kg/m³)
- `superplasticizer`: Amount of superplasticizer in the concrete mix (kg/m³)
- `coarseaggregate`: Amount of coarse aggregate in the concrete mix (kg/m³)
- `fineaggregate`: Amount of fine aggregate in the concrete mix (kg/m³)
- `age`: Age of the concrete (days)

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be accessed from the following link:

## Models

The project includes the following regression models for predicting concrete compressive strength (csMPa):

1. ADA Booster
2. GradientBoostingRegressor
3. DecisionTreeRegressor
4. ElasticNet
5. RandomForestRegressor
6. LinearRegression
7. Support Vector Regression (SVR)

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **data**: This directory contains the dataset file(s).

- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks or other relevant documents for data exploration and modeling.

- **models**: Saved model files, if applicable.

- **results**: This directory may include visualizations, reports, or any other output from the analysis.

- **README.md**: The main project documentation you are currently reading.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

  
   git clone https://github.com/hiranvjoseph/multiple-regression-concrete-data.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

   
   cd multiple-regression-concrete-data
 

3. Install the required dependencies. You may want to set up a virtual environment before installing dependencies.


   pip install -r requirements.txt
  

4. Download the dataset from the provided [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kushalvala/concrete/code) and place it in the `data` directory.

5. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts in the `notebooks` and `src` directories to explore the data, train the regression models, and evaluate their performance.
